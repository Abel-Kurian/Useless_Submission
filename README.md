### Project Description
"Funny Face Factory" is a web-based application utilizing facial recognition and image processing technologies to create humorous and shareable content. This interactive platform provides users with a user-friendly interface, various funny filters, and effects, fostering social interaction, creativity, and entertainment for users of all ages.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
1. "Selfies were too serious and meme-deprived."
2. "Faces lacked sufficient silliness."
3. "Social media profiles suffered from acute seriousness."
4. "The world needed more smile-inducing selfies."
5. "Laughter deficiency plagued online communities."
